Once upon a time, my girlfriend told me that she texts me way more than I text her. I wondered if that was true so by using iMessage data stored on my phone, I checked it out.
Turns out she was right..

To find out your messaging stats run:

```
python message_counter.py
```

inside the directory, and when the prompt comes up, insert the number you're curious about.

Limitations: Only works for US numbers and MacOS. Make sure your home directory is set to some kind of user.

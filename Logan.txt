text is_from_me
￼ 1
I like how you kept texting me anyway 0
Though out my interview 0
Ughhhhh I failed some qs 0
It was better than the last att one 0
But I'm bad at sorting algorithms lol 0
She asked a good sort and idk 0
I feel like that should be an easy q 0
merge sort 1
I didn’t text you I sent you pictures it’s different 1
See I had merge sort on my tongue because I read about it in algorithms but I couldn't remember what it is 0
I remember now though 0
yeah after you read algorithms you should implement some in actual code 1
What about for large set of data? Still merge sort? 0
just write it in your favorite language then you see what it really does 1
well merge sort is the fastest comparing sorting algorithm, but depending on the question a radix sort might be faster 1
Okay 0
Do you know the difference between process and thread 0
Or what data structure is used for recursion for storing variables 0
process is a set of instructions and thread is what carries out the instructions in an OS 1
that’s my understanding 1
a stack 1
is used to store variables 1
what I don’t understand your question 1
data structure is used for recursion for storing variables? 1
what does that mean? 1
When you do recursion, what data structure are local variables stored in? 0
a stack! 1
remember the stack pointer? 1
Okay 0
I just think of mips and I think of numbers 0
right but the data structure has to be a stack 1
cause you could only put in from one end 1
Okay why 0
and put out from one end 1
Okay 0
I don’t know if it’s right  1
That’s my educated guess 1
I have a lot to learn 0
At least I got some questions 0
well you’re supposed to learn in cs61c/b 1
most questions 1
what you need is a review 1
a frequent review 1
How though? Cracking the coding interview?  0
Algorithms helps with some 0
No like research papers I think help the most 1
you know what’s crazy 1
I’m texting you on my computer?! 1
This whole time 1
I do that too 0
I’m not on my phone 1
thats why you’re so fast 0
Never did this before 1
now i’m on my computer 0
Yeah I could type 80 words per min 1
woot woot 0
interviews are so scary 0
Yeah I know what you mean 1
now i have 3 hrs til class 0
the lady was nice though 0
They make me nervous 1
Yeah just keep reading at this point 1
You have 3 hours to read 3+ more chapters on algorithm 1
where do i find these research papers 0
i need to work on pixiboard though 0
cause we have meeting tomorrow 0
once you finish the book you should code up the algorithms in python 1
This isn’t a research paper but this is a good place to start 1
http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/ 1
ok 0
oh ‘pparently theres a t4c meeting tonight 0
i guess I’m going 0
Oh cool good luck 1
how did you apply for a9 it says you have to be a graduate student to be considered or an amazing bachelors 1
lol 0
career fair? 0
idk 0
hmm 1
oh i see 0
it does say exceptional bachelors 0
but they always say that 0
just apply 0
you have the qualifications 0
I do? why 1
prior internship experience 0
uhmmm okay 1
the languages 0
ec2 0
hadoop 0
lol 0
machine learning 0
where else should I apply for? 1
I really need a job 1
hm 0
I’m running low on money again 1
go look who’s hiring 0
indeed.com 0
i like the quotes on my homepage 0
￼ 0
Yeah I like mine too 1
you already downloaded it lol 0
Life is simple, if you’re happy, keep going, if you’re not change something 1
thats cool 0
hows your computer 0
So far an amazing experience 1
be careful with ti 0
I’ll probably get used to it in a little while 1
its a delicate flower 0
I like how I could move it around and it doesn’t restart randomly 1
Yes like Logan 1
Tomo I took a nap 0
Yay 1
No isn't that bad 0
I slept for like 12 hrs 0
I slept during class 0
And now I slept again 0
Ok 1
It's good though 1
Your a delicate flowers  1
Ahhhhh 0
And I was late to algorithms by 3 mins 0
This needs to stop Logan 0
No more sleeping all the time 0
Yea Logan wake up 1
I need to stay awake too to fix my sleeping part even  1
To fix what? 0
Maybe I need to do more things that interest me in my day so I don't feel like sleeping 0
Whenever he says log(n) I think he's saying my name 0
William got an offer at startup! 0
Lol 1
I'm eating with the bros again 0
Like a summer internship? 1
Yeah 0
Oh wow congrats to him 1
What's it called? 1
Print something 0
He told me about it the other day 0
Hmm tell him he seems like a start up kind of guy and make huge impact instead of a big organization type of person 1
hands down radix sorting is much faster than any other type of sorting 1
It's called simple prints  0
easiest photobook you’ve ever made 1
Yep 0
what time should I come tomorrow? 1
You're coming tomorrow? 0
Idk 0
Night 0

Okay I won’t come tomorrow then 1
You can come 0
no it’s okay 1
I was thinking of going there later 0
To San Mateo 0
okay sure come come 1
Tomorrow 0
okay 1
I can’t use vim it’s too frustruating 1
I’m going back to emacs 1
although that’s pretty frustrating too 1
Logan if you aren’t reading Algorithms I’m going to spank you 1
I was at t4c meeting 0
cool 1
So don't soank me 0
Favio said he likes my hair! Also Tom is so funny, and he's improv captain now. And so many people in t4c I don't know 0
Okay I’m going to sleep tonight 1

I love you 1
So early 0
I .. won’t see you tomorrow? 1
I don't know 0
you slept at 9:30 last night so not that different 1
Yeah wait 0
It’s so nice owning a laptop that works 1
I’m actually motivated to get some work done 1
So I think I have pixiboard at 10am in sf, so then I could just take bart to millbrae after that. But I also have room cleaning and bathroom cleaning to do so when should I do that 0
Just whenever you feel like 1
Did you break your "no internet" thing 0
I guess I'll do it Sunday then 0
pretty much but I’m coding which is good 1
Okay well sea 1
Disney sea?? 0
What are you coding 0
Maybe I just won't sleep tonight and I'll do everything 0
I'm redoing my ray tracer so I could get some anime character rendering done 1
Oh whoa 0
Not a good idea 1
Why not 0
I'm glad you like your computer 0
hey your messages are in a different font 0
I give up on pixiboard for now, I'm gonna clean my room and maybe upload Japan pictures. Or actually I can do that tomorrow with you 0
I'm still up but now I really go to bed 1

Okay so shop kick called me, I wasn't really expecting anything technical then she threw one question at me at the end and it kind of confused me 0
What is the worst case insertion for a hash table? 0
I said it would be constant, as long as the hash function is constant? 0
And for best case I said constant 0
Where are you 0
I'm thinking 1
But I don't get it, isn't that a weird question or no? 0
It's a pretty valid question 1
You need to have good understanding of how hash tables work 1
After I answered she asked when would a hash function be constant and then I just said like if it looks at the thing it was hashing 0
Which is a really broad answer 0
Makes not sense 0
What does she mean when would it be constant? 1
Because I was saying like it depends on how fast the hash function is 0
I don't know bro 0
Wait whatC 1
? 1
Or maybe she asked like what kind of hash function is best case 0
How can hash function be different speeds? 1
Are they all constant? 0
What if there's a loop or something lol 0
Where 1
In the hash function 0
What are you hashing first of all 1
I don't know 0
We're just talking best case and worse case 0
And average 0
You should've asked her 1
I didn't 0
She says they talked to me at the career fair this week but I really don't remember going there lol 0
Lol 1
I'm just saying next time really thouroughly ask  1

I don't know that's why I'm applying to inteenships 0
Ok 1
What do you think? 0

Stop what? 1
Being sexist 0
Against what? 1
Girls can be whatever they want 0
Sorry 1
I did say that it's a good idea though 1
Yeah 0
And you said that since I'm doing so bad in all interviews maybe it's a sign 0
I never said you were doing bad, companies might be forcibly rejecting you for whatever reason.  1
Yeah you didn't, I said that 0
And it might mean in a spiritual sense that you could strive for another path. 1
Hmm 0
Should 1
Not could 1
You didn't say it still 1
You don't trust me?? 0
I do 1
But I want to hear you say it 1
I don't see why this is even a question 0
But I like you more than Nathan 0
I mean was it that hard? 1

We learned that livestock emits more greenhouse gas than transportation 0
Getting a hybrid saves 1 ton of carbon emission per year, going vegan saves 1.5 tons 0
Also eating one less pound of meat saves the same amount of water as not showering for 6 months! 0

And 1 question 188 0
And no pixiboard 0
I got a interview with AMAZON!? 1
WEIRD!? 1
Yayatataaaa 0
Why weird 0
CAUSE I APPLIED FOR A9? 1
It's different  0
hmmm but it’s not 1
but okay 1
That's exciting when where 0
SEATTLE 1
summer 1
william 1
and I will be there together 1
No the interview 0
we’re meant to be 1
oh first it’s coding challenge online 1
Lol don't get too exciting 0
and then phone interview 1
and I own at phone interviews 1
Of course you do 0
Are you gonna not tell William 0
Why would I not tell William? 1
like surprise him 0
if something happens 0
Yeah 1
so you’re not 0
I'll keep it a secret 1
okay me too 0
Okay but I don't want
To be weak anymore I am getting this internship no matter what! 1
you never know what can happen 0
you’re not weak 0
I'm going to get this internship no matter what though! 1
okay i believe in you 0
are you stuyding 0
did you look at the coding challenge  0
did you really eat that gross thing 0
I'm hanging out with high school  1
Friends 1
oh 0
have fun 0
i might drop this 170 hw 0
Okay! 1
Okay! 0
I got a full time position for khan academy 1
what how 0
you didn’t even interview 0
? 0
No interview for full time position 1
That's what I meant 1
okay 0
thats cool! 0
Berkeleytime was taken away 0
Oh really 1
Why 1
People reported them on snapchat 0
Oh gaga 1
Gaga  0
Lol yeah lady 1
Version 1
Whaaaa 0
It's probably sub optimal 1
It works but it's too slow 1
That's means it doesn't work though 0
Cause this is minimal 0
Minimax  0
Yeah I don't know I would have to look at it 1
Ughhhhhhhhhghhhh 0
i think i’m confused about how to get the multiple ghosts thing to work 0
Hmm I wish I could help you 1
yeaaaaaaaah 0
Tessa's  1
what 0
Yessssssssss became Tessa's 1
are you still with your friends 0
No that ended long ago  1
ok 0
You want me to help? 1
ugh 0
i don’t know 0
I don't know either 1
can i ask you a q about implementation 0
Uhhh sure 1
okay, so i’m making minimax 0
Ok 1
but i’m confused how to make it for x amounts of ghosts 0
is it okay if, for the min part, i make a list of all possible end game states 0
then after that i find the min of that? 0
just for the ghosts part 0
Uhhh 1
One sec 1
Yeah ghost is part of the state 1
what 0
The ghost position should be counted as a possible heuristic  1
For the state value 1
what 0
So if the ghost are near you then bad score for the state or the move 1
it doesn’t matter 0
i think we’re on diff pages 0
i don’t have to evaluate anything 0
Wait what 1
they give you evaluation function 0
all i have to do is minimax 0
I don't know your question then.. 1
its okay 0
i’ll do piazza private post 0
Uhmm okay 1
i have no idea whats wrong 0
it seems like it should work 0
Hmm ok 1
Are you doing min for each ghost? 1
i find the game states with all possible positions for each ghost 0
then find the min of that 0
Hmm 1
￼ 0
if this is the normal min-state algorithm, 0
how do i modify it so that there are 2 or 3 ghosts? 0
Well each ghosts position is also a state so it's the same as one ghost 1
like, you call it more times? 0
Uhm no  1
like, for each successor of state: 0
Just move all the ghost and evaluate each state and pick the min out of all those 1
for each successor of state: 0
move all of them, then do the min after that? 0
Yeah  1
thats what i’m doing blegh 0
Or wait min is your move right? 1
min is ghosts move 0
Wait you want to max out of all ghost positions 1
Min is all possible paceman moves 1
hmmmmmmmmm 0
but i saw luis’s for one sec and they did min also for ghosts 0
Yeah ghost is mining over pacman positions 1
so you’re saying i should do max of the ghosts 0
why would it get the right path then 0
Aluyhh  1
yeah changing that doesn’t work 0
Uhmm I need to see your project 1
should i 0
Hmm 1
One sec give me 30 min 1
k watchu doin 0
Playing games online 1
lol 0
I’m gonna look at pixiboard 0
Q5 or q4? 1
q2 0
What's your evaluation function right now? 1
for q1? 0
Yeah can you take screenshot and send to me 1
but that’s not the one i have q about 0
I know I'm just trying to remember how to do this 1
okay! 0
q1 has nothing to do with other qs 0
I know 1
okay mine’s really long/random 0
￼ 0
￼ 0
I'm so confused 1
basically it looks at distance between closest food, distance from a ghost, and if its on a food 0
Can We Skype? 1
No I'm on q2 now sry 1
i’m in a sort of quiet study area 0
Oh... 1
Okay 1
oh do you want me to send you q2 0
I downloaded the project and now working through it 1
I know what it looks like 1
Can you make your own functions? 1
sure like helper functions yeah 0
i can call you and go outside for a sec if that helps 0
Okay then it's easy 1
Well sry 1
Not easy 1
No let me work through it 1
but but 0
that won’t help me fix mine 0
Okay send me your implementation right now 1
like copy paste or screeenshot 0
Just send me your multiagent.py 1
Through email 1
done 0
you’re texting from your computer right? 0
brb gonna bladder empty 0
Logan you went me a disastor  1
Sent me 1
It's not though 0
Eek I'm sorry 0
Code readability 0 1
Lol 1
in minimax right? 0
well there’s 3 main parts 0
if its an end state/win/lose 0
if you’re maximizing 0
or if you’re minimizing 0
Yeah I'm rewriting it 1
Don't worry 1
but i don’t want to change my code 0
i want to find out whats wrong 0
I know I'm just working through your code 1
It's really hard to read  1
some of its repeats too 0
Okay I think you have misunderstood what you have to do 1
for the ghosts part? 0
Instead of accumulating gamestates just treat each ghost like a pacman 1
so if there are 2 ghosts, 0
i go through each move in the first ghost, find the minimum 0
then what? 0
Then you send each state to the next ghost 1
Which is also a min 1
lemme think about it 0
And think about code readability too 1
It's hard to debug anything if there's just a text wall 1
and then when i get to the last ghost, is that when i return? 0
No then you get back to the pacman 1
You call the maximized 1
isn’t that what we do for all the ghosts? 0
imma thinking 0
i tried something but it didn’t work 0
oh whoops i did that on the wrong problem 0
now it says wrong number of states expanded 0
Hmm 1
I'm trying to figure it out too 1
i’ll stare at it a bit 0
Okay 1
hmmm now i see it’s skipping like half the tree 0
william says hi 0
Hmm 1
wait i had a return in  a for loop 0
that doesn’t work 0
Is your terminal condition correct? 1
yeah if win or lose or depth 0 right 0
its just ghosts thats wrong i’m pretty sure 0
When do you decrease depth? 1
Every agent? 1
not each ghost though 0
i guess like once after ghost and packman go 0
so after final ghost 0
Yes finally I got 5/5 1
wait one sec 0
You don't switch depth between pacman and ghost either! 1
You only decrease depth once pacman is called again 1
what do you mean 0
So let's say depth = 2 1
you don’t change depth til you go through packman and all ghosts 0
Yeah 1
And then you change depth 1
thats what i’m doing now i just keep getting weird error 0
That's what was screwing me over this whole time 1
And I noticed in your original code you kept returning your move 1
Just don't have to do that if you abtract things enough 1
I'll show you my solution if you give up 1
but but 0
did you use mine 0
No yours was too hard 1
ugh 0
I didn't know what was going on 1
You changed the game state name to state of game 1
Lol 1
And I was confused 1
cause recursion 0
well i guess i give up 0
if i want to sleep eventually 0
Okay don't copy it  1
no i won’t 0
Just try to mold it into your solution 1
yeses my meetings in berkeely tomorrow 0
one more hour of sleep for logan 0
I sent it 1
My codes readability is still pretty difficult but it should be a lot cleaner than yours 1
Ask me questions if there's any part you don't understand  1
Make sure to delete the email it's evidence that could be used against you 1
Hello? 1
i’m looking at it 0
Oh ok 1
Actually on second thought this is really bad 1
I shouldn't show you explicit code like this 1
so what do you wanna do 0
Give you the four function names and have you fill them our 1
Out 1
but i want to fix mine 0
Would've been a better idea 1
Yeah ok 1
Maybe make sure the terminal condition is at the beginning? 1
Of the function 1
yeah but mines diff 0
cause i need a move 0
to return 0
and i did try that 0
i think my functions still wrong 0
ew you did list comprehensions 0
? 1
What's that 1
like one line loop 0
its good though 0
Oh yeah sorry lol  1
That's what I was referring to when I said that my readability is still pretty bad 1
I could've laid it out in local variables before using it 1
i’m gonna make a move input to my function 0
For the next question you might want to adopt a solution that's similar to mine it makes it extremely simple to implement  1
uggggggg  0
ok 0
i’ll make it sort of like the pseudocode 0
from slides 0
Yeah  1
luis went to sinas campaign party 0
Lol 1
apparently sinas really drunk 0
Oh no 1

Seeing my parents usually puts me in the mood for studying 0
LOl you don’t want to disappoint them 1
Is that it? 0
Yeah they always ask about school/CS and im like oh yeahhhh that thing 0
But I found out more about the Kristy/Daniel thing 0
Gather was not as good as I hoped 0
oh why not? 1
What happened with Daniel and Kristy 1
I don't know, the food is kind of expensive but nothing special. And small portions 0
It was an ex boyfriend that she met up with! She asked Daniel if she could spend the day/night with her friend she was meeting up with, and he said just day (so she only spent the day), but later found out that it was the guy 0
She said that she was going to drink with her friends and the guy said something like "I hope for more sexy drunk texts" 0
Right before Daniel investigated what was going on, Kristy basically asked for a divorce and that he could make more money, said that he tricked her into marrying him 0
So they're splitting up soon I believe, they still haven't talked about the apparent cheating, Kristy said she's moving to her friend in Vegas (that's where the guy lives) and they're gonna split their house money and separate 0
The guy has a lot of money too 0
And right before they leave, Daniels gonna be like, have fun with ______! 0
wow 1
how rich is rich 1
Well more than Daniel? And being able to live in Vegas? Idk 0
Sounds like my dad makes sense 1
It really sucks though 0
Yeah girls just care about money at the end of the day 1
People? 0
Why girls 0
I never seen a guy leave a girl, because she was too poor 1
That's probably because of cultural things where guys need to make money and girl doesn't have to 0
yeahp 1
my mom left my dad bc of financial reasons 1
and kristy left daniel bc of financial reasons 1
Ugh 0
Ow my chair takes the blood out of my butt 0

Amazon is in the predictive search space so helping out qurious would be conflict of interest and could end up in a lawsuit 1
Against qurious 1
Oh okay 0
And I can't work for them after the internship for the same reason 1
But they wanted you to not do amaZon at all 0
Even after the internship what? 0

i spent almost 1000 dollar 1
and I spent more on restaurant than grocery 1

And transportation 0
I’m sure restaurant is at least $50 more because I at out 1
with cash 1
Ewwwww 0

Too much spending 0
yeah for sure 1
Maybe I could increase my grocery and decrease my restaurant as a goal this month 1
Idk what to do about public transportation 1
I should work from home more often 1
mint is pretty cool it generates budgets for me depending on how much I’m earning 1
and according to how much I’m earning I should spend around that much 1
money 1
Oh I see 0
I agree with increasing grocery decreasing restaurant 0
I should have a solid $300 for grocery and maybe $80 for restaurant 1
$20 per week 1
Isn't that more than you spent before 0
Just make sure food doesn't go to waste from grocery cause then you lose money 0
well restaurant is probably like 200 1
that’s true 1
I need to make sure my grocery food is consumed 1
Frozen foods can help cause they don't go bad (for dinner) 0
Then pack a lunch and snacks 0
yeah 1
I think I’m going to primarily work from home from now on 1
depending on how much they pay me 1
If you do, you should tell them it's because of transportation costs 0
yeah I think I’ll just show them this chart directly 1

I saw dream where Taylor swift came to my house to observe how a computer science family works. You kept embarrassing yourself because you didn't ask like yourself, and I just acted like it was a learning experience 1
Lol you are a "computer science family" 0
It was a weird dream 1
Lol did you watch taylor swift’s instagram video of the sibling fighting for the easter egg 1
it’s so funny 1
Yeah I did 0
who are they? 1
Who? 0
those people 1
What people 0
My other boyfriends? 0
the siblings 1
I only remember one in the video 0
There's Austin swift I think? 0
Just ate lunch with mama at sliver 0
Today is such a rush 0

mama kel 1
Lol 0
Mammal 0
She had a dream I was pregnant 0
did you tell her we got close 1
What do you mean? 0
She wants to know if there are any marijuana related jobs for r.n.'s 0
And she knows why Cassidy was mad at Ashton but she's sworn to secrecy 0
LOL I wonder why?! 1
AGHHHHHHHH 1
IM SO CURIOUS 1
cassidy cats may not be Jesus, but they could flip right when they’re able to die, letting them live, so you should probably tell me since I’m super curious 1
I just sent her this 1
Don't repeat this, but all she said was that it's something that Cassidy will look back on and think its a silly reason to be mad. She said there's just tension cause they broke up 0
No Tomo I don't think it's yours to know 0
And please don't repeat what I said 0
interresant 1
ok 1
Background checks are so weird, especially since I never really had a job 0
They need the phone number for Tara's to verify the dates that I worked there 0
weird 1
att is very peculiar 1
It's annoying because it makes me feel like they don't trust me, except I guess it's not totally att but the company they use to do background checks 0
yeah probablly 1
So tired can't be 0
My arm is tired from carrying my book today 0
There's a picture advertisement thing on Taylor swifts fb with Sam smith too, looking into each other's eyes 0
But when I look up "Sam smith gay" I see that he came out as gay 0
omg they need more than a phone number, I don’t have w2 forms or anything blegh this is stress 0
i emailed them 0
What?! Seriously.. I never got anything like for a background check... 1
they need proof of my employment dates 0
cause not working at Tara is going to make you a worse coder? 1
I know ugh I just think they're making sure I didn't lie 0
And they probably don't even know what position, they just do it for everyone  0
It's this company called hireright 0
I'm walking to soda 0
Make sure I get there 0
Oh 1
Ok 1

Yeah 1
She asked my dad if I'm graduating in 2016 cause they're hiring for android development 0
Isn't this kind of early though? 0
For pandora 0
Okay if they're hiring for android development you should start making android apps and be really familiar with their underpinnings 1
But I'm sending her my resume this weekend 0
I hope papad won't want to speak to me again 0
